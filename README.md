## An Interactive Image Segmentation Filter for Multiplex Microscopy.

CyLinter is quality control software for identifying and removing cell segmentation instances corrupted by optical and/or image-processing artifacts in multiplex microscopy images. The tool is user-guided and comprises a set of modular and extensible QC modules instantiated in a configurable [Python](https://www.python.org) Class object. Module results are cached to allow for dynamic restarts.

CyLinter development is led by [Greg Baker](https://github.com/gjbaker) at the [Laboratory of Systems Pharmacology](https://hits.harvard.edu/the-program/laboratory-of-systems-pharmacology/about/), Harvard Medical School.

## Scientific summary

![Summary figure](./docs/Orion_fig1a.png)

Precision medicine is critically dependent on better methods for diagnosing and staging disease and predicting drug response. Histopathology using Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained tissue - not genomics – remains the primary diagnostic method in cancer. Recently developed highly-multiplexed tissue imaging methods promise to enhance research studies and clinical practice with precise, spatially-resolved, single-cell data. Here we describe the “Orion” platform for collecting H&E and high-plex immunofluorescence images from the same cells in a whole-slide format suitable for diagnosis. Using a retrospective cohort of 74 colorectal cancer resections, we show that IF and H&E images provide human experts and machine learning algorithms with complementary information that can be used to generate interpretable, multiplexed image-based models predictive of progression-free survival. Combining models of immune infiltration and tumor-intrinsic features achieves a nearly 20-fold discrimination between rapid and slow (or no) progression, demonstrating the ability of multi-modal tissue imaging to generate high-performance biomarkers.

## Data availability

Full-resolution images, derived imaging data, and single-cell spatial feature tables will be released by the National Cancer Institute sponsored [repository for Human Tumor Atlas Network](https://htan-portal-nextjs.vercel.app/). While the public resource is still undergoing extensive development, we provided [exemplar data](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn38990468) via [Synapse](https://www.synapse.org/#) for demonstration purposes. Light-weight image viewing for all the bio-specimens used in this study is made available using [Minerva](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story) and [Scope2Screen](https://github.com/labsyspharm/scope2screen) [[1]](#1).


### Exemplar data ([`syn38990468`](https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn38990468))

To download, please refer to the [Synapse documentation](https://help.synapse.org/docs/Finding-and-Downloading-Data.2003796231.html)

### Image viewing using web browsers

Light-weight image viewing for all the bio-specimens used in this study is made available using [Minerva](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story) and [Scope2Screen](https://github.com/labsyspharm/scope2screen) [[1]](#1). Visit https://www.tissue-atlas.org/atlas-datasets/lin-chen-campton-2023/ to access the images.


### Access the full dataset

All images at full resolution, derived image data (e.g., segmentation masks),
and single-cell tables are stored and can be accessed through Amazon Web
Services (AWS) S3 once the publication is live. Detailed information and list of
files are documented [here](datarelease-README.md).

## Codes for imaging data processing

Highplex Orion whole-slide images were processed using [MCMICRO](https://mcmicro.org/) modules with customizations to cope with the large X-Y dimension in the dataset. Registration of Orion immunofluorescence images and post-Orion H&E images was done with [PALOM](https://github.com/yu-anchen/palom).


### Files in the `scripts-processing/` folder

To process Orion images into single tables, we ran `unmicst` and `S3segmenter` to generated labeled mask and run `quantification` using the segmentation mask and the 19-channel Orion image. Version and repositories of the processing modules is listed in the `github_repo.md` file.

- conda-env yaml files: environment specs for creating conda envs to run customized mcmicro modules
- `github_repo.md` file: version and repositories of the processing modules
- `.py` files: scripts for batch processing multiple input images
- `file_list.csv` file: file index for batch processing
- `markers.csv` file: antibody target names of channels in the Orion images

### Demo for running the analysis and plotting scripts

Please contact the authors for detailed information.

```matlab

markers = {'CD3','CD8','CD45','CD45RO','CD68','CD163','CD4','CD20','SMA'};
regions = {'R1','R2'};
figure;

for i = 1:length(markers)
    for j = 1:length(regions)
        subplot(3,6,(i-1)*length(regions)+j);
        marker1 = strcat('norm_',markers{i},regions{j});
        list1 = sumAllsample{:,marker1};
        list2 = sumAllsample.PFSDays;
        scatter(list1,list2,30,'b','fill');
        lsline;
        title(num2str(corr(list1,list2),'%0.2f'),'FontSize',16);
        set(gca,'xtick',[]);
        xlabel(marker1,'Interpreter','none');
        set(gca,'ytick',[]);
        ylabel('PFS Days');
    end
